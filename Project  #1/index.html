          <h2>Sr. Data Scientist | Machine Learning | AWS | Azure |</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Throughout my career, I have blended technical expertise with strategic acumen across various roles in technology and data science. Starting as an ML Engineer at Dufico Consulting Company, I analyzed mining samples using advanced machine learning techniques, laying a solid foundation in data-driven problem-solving. I later transitioned to Dufico College as a course manager, developing curricula for AI, ML, Data Science, and programming courses, and preparing students for tech careers. </li>
            <li>As a Big Data Consultant at NAVTTC, I enhanced the commission's data analytics capabilities, optimizing educational programs. Currently, at KeepCoders, I serve as a Solution Architect and Data Scientist, leading projects across AI, ML, and cloud technologies (AWS, GCP, Azure), managing teams, and handling client interactions.</li>
            <li>Parallel to my corporate roles, I've pursued a successful freelance career, creating solutions in fields such as computer vision, recommendation systems, stock price prediction, NLP, and chatbots. This independent path has not only diversified my skills but also generated significant revenue, highlighting my ability to marry technical skills with an entrepreneurial spirit.</li>
